# Features
Structured HTML: The HTML file defines the structure of the nutrition label, organizing information such as serving size, calorie content, and daily values.
Styling with CSS: CSS styles are applied to HTML elements to ensure consistent typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy throughout the label.
Custom Divider Styles: Custom CSS classes define different divider styles, adding visual interest and separating sections of the label.<br>


**Clear Visual Hierarchy:** The use of font weight, size, and spacing creates a clear visual hierarchy, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the label.
